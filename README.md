# Flashcards

Flashcards to help with studying for courses.

## Quickstart

```
./flashcards.py flashcards_file.txt
```

Press `<Enter>` to get the next flashcard.

## Online

An online version of the flashcards program can be found at [tpcstld.me/fc](http://tpcstld.me/fc).
However, support is not guaranteed.

## Vim Syntax Highlighting

`quiz.vim` contains some basic VIM syntax highlighting for the `.quiz` files.

You can install it by copying `quiz.vim` to your `.vim/syntax` folder and
running `:set syntax=quiz` after loading the quiz file.

## Contributions

If you're taking a course with me, pull requests are welcome!

See the docstring in `flashcards.py` for the flashcards file format.
