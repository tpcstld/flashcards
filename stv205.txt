# Week 7

* Who is Heinz von Foerster?

- A physicist and philosopher.
- Worked in biology and ethics.
- Founding Biological Computing Laboratory in 1958.
- Called for the first major conference on self-organizing systems (i.e. biology side)

* What are the soft and hard sides of cybernetics?

Soft: Biology
Hard: Computation

* What is the constructivist approach to philosophy?

We actively make our understanding of the world.

* What is second-order cybernetics?

The cybernetics of observing systems.

* What is sousveillance?

The recording of people via small wearable recorders. It is not considered
second-order because people are not really empowered to do anything with the
recordings.

* What is technological determinism?

The belief that technological development is a first-order system.
It cannot be controlled, and is autonomous, self-organizing, directionless, and
inevitable.
Technological development drives social structures and cultural values. (e.g.
unintended consequences.

* What is technological constructivism?

The belief that technological development is a second-order system.
It is not autonomous, we can direct it.
Our values drive technological development.

* What did Weiner use his "imaginative forward glance" to see?

- Antibiotics would cause super-viruses.
- Synthetic foods would cause carcinogens.
- Automation would cause unemployment.

* What did Weiner feel about moral responsibility of professions?

Scientists and engineers had a moral responsibility to control their
innovations. They could decide if something was to be developed.

* Who was John von Neumann?

Founded game theory as mathematical discipline. Credited with the
minimax theorem (can minimize maximum losses), and mutual assured destruction.

* What is the problem with programming machines for war?

AI might do things that are against human goals, like national survival.

* What is the technological singularity?

The point at which machines can improve themselves.

* What were McLuhan's thoughts about the world?

In the past, things became more fragmented (e.g. during the renaissance.). But
now things are becoming more and more connected.

* What's the deal with integration and networks?

A network needs non-technical feedback for it to be holistically integrated into
society.

# Week 8

* Who is Gregory Bateson?

- Married to Margaret Mead.
- Schismogenesis (positive feedback loops breaking relationships)
- Double bind (behaving in two incompatible ways simultaneously)

* What is behavioural sciences?

- Information calculus: Modeling human judgements and language.
- Using cybernetic feedback to model human decision making.

* How was information calculus used?

Measuring how we responded to a stimulus (e.g. reaction time)
Measuring our ability to transmit information.

* According to schismogensis, how are schisms generated between groups?

1. Boasting. (I'm better, no I'm better...)
2. Submissive behaviour.

* Who is Stafford Beer?

- Need to figure out how to remain stable but adaptive.

* What is a system?

The configuration of a solution to a large-scale practical problem.
Holsitic, demands compromise and judgement.

* What is a network?

The configuration of a solution to a large-scale technical problem.
Mechanistic, demands compliance.

* What is a web?

The configuration of a solution to a large-scale natural problem.
Organic, demands commitment.

* What is a collage?

The configuration of a solution to a large-scale artificial problem.
Synthetic, demand engagement.

* What is the cultural body?

Discovers meaning in a web of relationships.
Health is being affective, illness is injury that needs healing.
Health care is a web of ideals, care is being compassionate.

* What is the social body?

Negotiates meaning with other social bodies.
Health is effective performance, illness is a breakdown that needs repair.
Health care is a system of goals.

* What is the functional body?

A device that is defined by a network of operations.
Health is efficient operation, illness is a malfunction that needs fixing.
Health care is a network of objectives.

* What is the virtual body?

Mirror, photograph, MRI...
Defined by a collage of statistics.
Health is a desirable self-image, illness is exposure to reality that needs
spinning.
Health care is a collage of desires.

* What is the quantified self movement?

A movement to incorporate technology and data into one's daily life.
Self-tracking through technology.

* What is big data?

Data that is so voluminous that traditional data processing is inadequate.

# Week 9

* What is technology?

An ensemble of machineries and procedures.

* What is the deterministic view of technology?

Encompassing and irresistable force.
Optimistic: Welcome the problems and blessings.
Pessimistic: Technology is culturally destructive.

* What are pessimistic deterministics rejected as?

Luddites, dystopian, romantics.

* What is the instrumentalist view of technology?

It is neither good nor bad.
Depends on our values.

* What is the problem with the deterministic view of technology?

People and society have a lot of discretion in adopting new devices.

* What is the problem with the instrumentalist view of technology?

Ignores the fact that technology has shaped society.

* What is the paradigmatic view of technology?

It is a pattern or paradigm we have agreed to follow in dealing with
reality.

* What is third-order cybernetics?

Culture and art in the feedback loop.

* Who is Marshall McLuhan?

- Coined "medium is the message" and the "global village".
- Predicted the World Wide Web.

* What is the job of the artist in third-order cybernetics?

To look for patterns in society and bring them to life.
To keep humans human.

* What is the purpose of anti-utopian stories?

Critique attempts to make an utopia without considering the trade-offs.

* What is the purpose of dystopian stories?

Critique how we can go too far with a technological paradigm.

* What is the R.U.R?

Rossum's Universal Robots. Robots killing all humans.

* What is the difference between the android and the human w.r.t obediance?

Androids must obey. Humans may not.

# Week 10
