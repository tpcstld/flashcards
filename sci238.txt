* What is the astronomical unit?

The average distance of the Sun from the Earth.

* What are a Parsec?

The arcseconds in which a star shifts in the course of a year.

Highlands: Cratered. Older rocks.
Maria: Smooth. No craters, younger rocks. Formed from lava overflow.

* What is the surface like on the far side of the Earth?

There are no maria. Thicker crust.
This is caused because during the formation of the Moon, the Earth was hot,
which caused the maria.

* What is the Giant Impact Hypothesis?

During the formation of the Moon, there were lots of large orbiting objects.
There was a big grazing collision from another "planet" and Earth.
The material ejected from this collision formed the Moon (from both Earth and
the other planet).

Short-period, big planets. These were the first exoplanets that were discovered.

* What is a transit?

The exoplanet traveling in front of the star from the perspective of the Earth.
We can measure the drop in brightness caused by transits, and the amount the
sun dims by also tells us how large the planet is.

# Lecture 12 - Stars

* How are the fundamental distances to stars determined?

From stellar parallax, leveraging the orbit of the Earth throughout the year.

* What is the parsec?

The distance from which one would have a parallax of 1 arcsecond.

* What are the first stars measured using parallax?

61 Cyngni, by Dessel and Vega, by Struve.

* What is a star's brightness proportional to?

1 / distance^2

* What is the difference between brightness and luminosity?

Brightness is the total light energy collected from an object, while luminosity
is the total light energy emitted.

* What is the magnitude system for measuring brightness?

Invented by Hipparcos and refined by Ptolemy. A log scale for brightness.
First magnitude stars are 100 brighter than 6th magnitude stars.

* What is the difference between apparent and absolute magnitude?

Apparent: Brightness measured or observed.
Absolute: Brightness a star would have a distance of 10 parsecs.

Mostly temperature. Red (1000K) is cooler than blue (10000K).
Dust can also redden starlight.
The ratio of the brightnesses in two wavelengths.

* What is the standard classification of stars?

The OBAFGKM classification, which was later added to include subtypes (#s) and
widths of spectral lines (roman #s).

* What are brown dwarfs?

Objects that formed like stars, but didn't have the mass necessary for hydrogen
fusion. However, they can fuse Lithium or deuterium.

* What were brown dwarf's impact on the spectral classification system?

They didn't fit the classification system, and instead were found to be two
distinct types of stars.

L dwarfs: cooler than M9 stars, strong lines of metal hydrides, water absorption
T dwarfs: even cooler, dominated by bands of water and methane.

* What is the differences between stellar spectra and photometry?

Spectra requires bigger telescopes, but gives fine details.
Photometry gives good estimates, but is easier to do.

* What is the HR diagram?

Named after the people who invented it, it is a mass/spectra plot of stars.

* What is the main sequence w.r.t stars?

The line where most stars lie around in the mass/spectra plot.

Astrometric: Only one star is visible, which moves around in a loop/wave.
Spectroscopic: Only one star is visible, shows no visible motion, but we can
detect with doppler shifts.
Eclipsing: One star passes in front of the other.

* What determines the lifetime of stars?

1. The amount of fuel (mass); and
2. The rate at which the star uses up the fuel.

Most massive stars have the shortest lives.

* What is the assumption we make about star clusters?

All stars in a cluster are roughly the same age, because they are form at the
same time in the same gas cloud.

* What are the 3 types of star clusters?

1. Associations: 100 stars
2. Open: 1000s stars
3. Globular: 100000 - 1000000 stars

* What does stellar motion tell us about stars?

Motion tells us about the gravity acting on the stars. More motion means
stronger gravity.

# Lecture 13 - Star clusters

* What are open clusters?

Loosely bound clusters of stars. Just formed by mutual gravity.
All stars orbit their collective center of mass, but might not be all in the
same plane.

* What are globular clusters?

Clusters of 100000s of stars in a spherical shape. These clusters are usually
very old. We assume they were the first stars to form.

* What is an assumption with star clusters?

All stars in the cluster are approximately the same age. This means that you can
determine the age of the cluster by measuring which stars are still on the
main sequence.

* What is an major assumption in stellar astrophysics?

If two stars have identical spectra and are on the Main Sequence, then they
are identical stars.

* What are pulsations in variations stars?

The star increases and decreases in size, which make also cause the surface
temperature to also vary.

* What are the 3 types of variable stars?

1. Pulsating stars.
2. Eruptive variables.
3. Rotating "spotted".

* What are the 3 common types of pulsating stars?

Cepheid: Period of 3-50 days, 0.2 magnitude variation, -1.5 to -5 absolute.
RR Lyrae: Period <1day, 1 absolute magnitude.
Mira: Period 80-600 days, large range in brightness

* What is the instability strip?

The place in the HR diagram that contains pulsating stars. This is caused by the
fact that heat cannot get out of the star, so it must pulsate instead to
release the heat.

* What is the period-luminosity law of cepheids?

Knowing L, b, we can find their distance (b = L/4pid^2)

Cepheid's pulsation period is related to its luminosity (and therefore radius).

* What are novae?

Stars that, one in a while, become much brighter (10000x) than before. Some
stars will repeat this behaviour decades/centuries later.

* How common are stellar collisions?

Very rare, but they can happen in dense clusters of stars.

## Nebulae

* What is a nebula?

Clouds of dust and gas in space.

* What is the difference between emission and reflection nebulae?

Emission: Illuminated by their own light.
Reflection: Illuminated by nearby stars' light. (More dusty)

# Lecture 14 - Star Formation

* What is the Interstellar Medium (ISM)?

Gas and dust between the stars.

* What are molecular clouds?

Higher density interstellar clouds. They have enough dust to block visible light
from stars. Stars are born in molecular clouds.

* When do interstellar clouds collapse?

When gravity and pressure become unbalanced.

* What is the Jeans Mass?

The maximum mass at which an interstellar cloud is stable. (Won't collapse.)

* What are the 3 main stages of early star formation?

1. Collapse begins; Caused by a shockwave
2. Fragmentation; Many cores formed from a single core
3. Core to protostar; Gas falls to central core

* How do cloud cores collapse?

Into a disk, with a bipolar outflow along the disk rotation axis.

* What is a protostar?

A central star with an accertion disk. Luminosity of star is dominated by
accretion.

* What is a pre-main sequence star?

The early stages of a star, where the surface cools allowing for further
collapse. Luminosity is dominated by contraction of star.

* What factors can inhibit star formation?

Magnetic fields; which inhibits the cloud from contracting.
Radiation from nearby stars; which changes the flow of the cloud.

* How does a pre-main sequence star form into a main sequence star?

Thermal energy escapes from the star, causing the star to contract, causing
even higher pressure and temperature inside the star. At some point, the core
is so hot that hydrogen can fuse into helium.

* How do stars join the main sequence?

Temperature increases. They join in from the "right" of the HR diagram. The more
luminous the star the faster they join the main sequence.

* What does the Stellar Initial Mass Function tell us?

It appears that far more low mass stars are produced than higher mass stars.

* What is the CNO cycle?

In massive stars (with hot enough cores), stars can use Carbon as a catalyst
for H -> He fusion.

* How does energy get out of a star?

High mass: Convective core, radiative envelope.
Intermediate mass: Radiation, outer convection zone.
Low mass: Convective "to the core".

# Lecture 15 - Stellar Evolution

* What happens when there is not enough hydrogen in the stars' core?

Core contraction accelerates.

* What are a star's death fusion cycles?

Successive fusion cycles until core temperature/pressure cannot be reached for
the next reactions to occur. Each cycle is shorter than the last, and more
temperature sensitive.

Eventually, the envelope is shed, leaving just the core behind.

* What is a helium flash?

Because low mass (<2.5Msum) stars struggle to fusion helium, the core becomes
degenerate and sudden ignition causes the core to expand and then shrink
suddenly.

* What happens after Helium is burned?

If the star is above 8Msun, it can still burn Carbon and Oxygen, but otherwise
that's about it.

* What are red giants?

Stars near the end of its lifetime, where it as expanded and cooled down.

* What is a white dwarf?

A star near the very end of its lifetime, it has blown off all of its
surrounding layers, and a carbon-based core remains.

Properties:
- Very dense
- Lots of radiation
- Glowing gas
- More massive the star, smaller the white dwarf.
- Supported by electron degeneracy pressure.

Created when a stellar core less than 1.4Msun dies.

* What is a planetary nebula?

Glowing gas due to energy imparted by a white dwarf shedding its envelope.

* What is the problem with fusing Iron?

Iron absorbs energy when fused, unlike the elements before it. This causes
the star to collapse.

* What is the structure of a high-mass star just before the end?

It has multiple layers, fusing different elements together.

* How does a dying high-mass star move on the HR diagram?

To the straight right, and then maybe back left a bit.

* What is a supernova?

An exploding star. It has a supernova remnant, which is the gas and material
expelled by the star.

* Why are supernovas important for our existence?

Heavier elements are created by supernova, and these get distributed throughout
the universe.

## Neutron stars

* What are neutron stars?

A star made up almost entirely out of neutrons. They are supported by
neutron degeneracy pressure. It is also spinning super-fast due to the
conservation of angular momentum.

Created when a stellar core less than 3Msun dies.

It also has a crust with just "normal" matter, that has been squeezed

* What is a pulsar?

Neutron stars that have two "polar" beams of energy. Neutron stars spin
really fast so that the pulses will wash over the Earth periodically.

* What are magnetars?

Neutron stars with unusually strong magnetic fields. They are the most
magnetic objects in the universe.

* What is a star quake?

Conflict in force between the neutron's core and crust can cause an "earthquake".
This creates a "solar flare" that is insanely powerful.

A star quake once blinded an x-ray satellite, compressed Earth's magnetic field,
ionize upper atmosphere.

## Black holes

* What are black holes?

Created when a stellar core more than 2.8Msun dies.

* What is the event horizon?

0.0...1s: 4 forces were split up.
3m: Subatomics could form
3-20m: Atoms could form, forming H, He, Li and deuterium
20m: Fusion stopped due to cooling.
380000yrs: Electrons could combine with nuclei.

* What is inflation?

At some point, space suddenly expanded sharply. This "smoothed" out the
cosmic microwave background as lumps had no time to form before they were
separated and flattened out.

* Why is the Era of Atoms called the cosmic dark ages?

Because hydrogen doesn't really emit protons, so little information can be
obtained.

* What is the current era of the universe?

Era of Galaxies.

1. Why is there an imbalance in anti-matter?
2. Where does the structure come from?

4. Why is the density of matter almost exactly the critical density?

* What would have happened if the universe was not at the critical density?

If matter was 10% more dense, the universe would have collapsed by now.
If matter was 10% less dense, galaxies would not have formed.

* How old is the universe?

About 14 billion years old.

# Lecture 16 - The Milky Way

* What is the interstellar medium made of?

Hydrogen, in many forms
Some other common molecules, like water and carbon monoxide.
Cosmic rays, Magnetic fields, dust.

* How does the interstellar medium affect light?

Dust obscures visible light, and reddens visible light by scattering the
bluer photons more.

* What is the cosmic cycle of the elements?

Interstellar gas forms stars. Stars convert elements into heavier elements.
When stars die they put the enriched elements back into the cloud. Therefore
the metallicity of the universe is constantly increasing.

They are like "traffic" jams, material is piling up in the arms. The objects
in the spiral arms are transient, the arm is like a wave.

Collisions in the spiral arms also help new stars form.

* What is the bulge?

A cylindrical cluster of very old stars. There is a central bulge, where all
stars (no matter how close) orbit with the same period.

# Lecture 17 - Galaxies

Andromeda.

* What are the four types of galaxy?

1. Spiral; like the Milky Way
2. Elliptical; Large rounded balls of stars; little gas; no disks

They cannibalize smaller galaxies around them.

* How do we think ring galaxies exist?

A small galaxy collides with the direct center a big galaxy, flinging out
the stars away from the core.

* What are active galaxies?

Galaxies outputting unusually large amounts of energy. (Gamma rays.)
They are (mainly) caused by the central black holes absorbing material.

* What is a quasar?

Quasi-stellar radio source. Galaxies far away that appears like a single store.

* What is in the center of galaxies?

A huge black hole. We believe that these form at the same time that the
galaxies do.

* What is an accretion disk?

A disk outside of the black hole. Collisions and other stuff heats up the
material inside the disk, making them glow.

* What are jets?

Magnetic fields along the poles of the accretion disk, spiting out material.
We believe that active galaxies are just galaxies with the jets pointed at us.

* What is the local group?

A few dozen galaxies around the Milky Way (and Andromeda).

* What is a galaxy cluster?

10s of millions lightyears across.
Virgo Cluster is one of them.

The "darkest" part of the sky, and even that has billions of stars and thousands
of galaxies.

# Gamma Ray Bursts

* What were the Vela satellites?

Satellites that scanned for gamma-rays to detect nuclear explosions.
It actually detected gamma-ray bursts from deep space.

* What is the distribution of gamma-ray bursts?

Random positions in the sky, which meant that they were not from the Milky Way
galaxy.

* What is the supernova cause of gamma-ray bursts?

A concentrated supernova burst. It comes from the jets emitted from the poles
of the accretion disks.

* What is the neutron star cause of gamma-ray bursts?

Two neutron stars collide with each other. If their combined mass is > 2.8Msun
then a black hole is formed, and the neutrons form into an accretion disk with
the same jets.

# Dark Matter

* What was Rubin's surprising discovery about gas cloud velocities?

The further away a gas cloud is, the faster they were moving. At best, the
velocities were flatten. This meant that the gravity in the galaxy was
smooth, not concentrated in the middle.

* How much dark matter is there?

6-7 times visible matter.

* What is an axion?

A particle with mass, but does not emit much light. They also don't interact
with normal matter.

* What is gravitational lensing?

Since gravity bends light, it is possible for heavy objects (i.e. black holes)
to bend light, so you can see behind the black hole.

* How did gravitational lensing let us "see" dark matter?

We were able to use gravitational lensing to see that dark matter passed through
each other when two galaxies collided.

* Why was dark matter important in history?

Without dark matter, it wouldn't be possible for large structures to form in the
early beginnings of the universe, since big structures (i.e. galaxies) could not
form with all the energy emitted by stars.

# Lecture 18 - Expanding universe

Rotation curve: Works well for nearby, edge-on spiral galaxies.
Velocity dispersion
Motions of galaxies around each other.

The existence of the Cosmic Microwave Background.
The expected Helium abundance in the universe.

* What was Slipher's observation about the universe?

Slipher determined that the galaxies were all moving away from each other (
because they were all red-shifted).

* What is the velocity of galaxies vs their distance?

The further a galaxy is, the faster they are moving away from us.

* What is the lookback time?

Since light has a finite velocity, the further away a light source is, the
more "in the past" the object is.

* What is the microwave background radiation?

The redshifted light from the early stages of the universe. It was caused by the
emission of photons from the recombination of electrons binding with the
nucleus in the early stages of the universe.

* Why is the Cosmic Microwave Background not from the beginning of the universe?

Because the universe was opaque, since it was filled with particles that could
absorb photons.

To get a higher resolution picture of the Cosmic Microwave Background.

* What is the measured age of the universe?

13.8 billion years.

* What is the rate of the rate of expansion in the universe?

Accelerating.

* What is the observable universe?

The distance at which if light is emitted, it will never reach us. This distance
is "decreasing" everyday as the universe is expanding.

* What is the Planck Era?

The "first instant" of the universe. Our current models are unable to describe
what happened in this era.

* What is the GUT Era?

10^-42 to 10^-38 seconds.
The Universe contained two natural forces: Gravity and The Grand Unified Theory.
Electromagnetic + strong + weak were just all one force.

* What happened when the universe cooled out of the GUT Era?

When the strong force "froze out" of the GUT force, the energy released caused
a sudden and dramatic inflation of the universe.

* What was the Electroweak Era?

10^-38 to 10^-10 seconds.
3 Forces: Gravity, Strong, Electroweak.

* What is the Particle Era?

10^-10 to 10^-3 seconds.
All 4 forces were distinct.
Quarks combined to form protons, neutrons, and their anti-particles.

* What is the Era of Nucleosynthesis?

10^-3 seconds to 3 minutes.
Protons and neutrons fused into hydrogen and helium, among other atoms.

* What is the Era of Nuclei?

3 minutes to 3.8 x 10^5 years
Universe was a plasma of nuclei and electrons.

* What is the Era of Atoms?

3.8 x 10^5 to 10^9 years.
Universe was filled with atomic gas, as atoms formed.

* What is the Era of Galaxies?

10^9 years to now.
First galaxies came into existence.

* Why is the large-scale Universe so smooth?

Because when the strong force froze out of the GUT force, the release of
energy caused sudden inflation.

* Why is the density of matter almost critical?

Because if it wasn't we would not have been able to live in this universe.

# Lecture 20 - Structure formation

* How are galaxies distributed in the sky?

They seem to be clumpy. Long strings to galaxies and galaxy clusters surrounding
"voids". This implies that there is some large scale structure to the universe,
and that the Universe is "foamy".

* How does a galaxy's birth determine its type?

- Initial angular momentum determines how fast the cloud will form a disk.
- Initial density determines how fast the cloud can form stars before it
collapses into a disk.

* How do galaxy interactions determine their type?

When galaxies collide, tidal forces randomize the orbits of stars, allowing
elliptical galaxies to form.

* How is black hole mass correlated with galaxy mass?

The large the central black hole, the more massive the galaxy.

* How do very big galaxies form?

By merging and absorbing smaller galaxies.

# Lecture 21 - Extraterrestrial Life

* Why is there renewed interest in searching for extraterrestrial life?

- We discovered extrasolar planets.
- We found that liquid water can exist on other worlds.
- We found organic molecules throughout the solar system and galaxy.
- We discovered that life existed on Earth as soon as it was possible.
- Organisms can survived in extreme conditions.

* What is astrobiology?

The study of life in the universe.

* Why are we searching for oxygen in atmospheres?

It is hard to replenish oxygen, and the best mechanism we know of is biology.

* Why do we think getting life to form is easy?

Because the time life existed on Earth was close the earliest moment when
liquid water existed on Earth, which kind of implied that life could exist
in very harsh conditions.

* What is SETI?

"If aliens are out there, we can communicate with them via radio."

* What are some solutions to the Fermi Paradox?

- We are alone, the first life to attain self-awareness.
- No one has colonize the galaxy.
- There is a Galactic civilization that has concealed itself from us.
