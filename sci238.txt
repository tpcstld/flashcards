# L3 - Astronomy as a science

* What is the astronomical unit?

The average distance of the Sun from the Earth.

* What are a Parsec?

The arcseconds in which a star shifts in the course of a year.

* How do we measure the distances of very far stars?

By comparing the apparently brightness of the stars. Since we can assume that
similar stars have the same intrinsic brightness.

# Earth

* How is the Earth heated?

- Leftover heat from formation
- Gravitational compression
- Radioactive decay
- Heavy elements sinking creates friction

* How are Earth's magnetic fields generated?

From the convection of metals in the Earth's core.

* What is the Earth's magnetic field do?

- Protects the Earth from Sun's solar winds (protects atmosphere).

* What is the line between Earth's atmosphere and space?

100 km.

* Where is the Earth's atmosphere warmest?

The surface.

* What is Ozone used for?

Protects against UV radiation.

* How are the northern lights formed?

Solar wind particles interacting with the atmosphere.

* What are the two types of Earth's crust?

Continental and oceanic.

* What does CO2 do in Earth's atmosphere?

Traps Infrared radiation, heating up the Earth.

# Moon

* How many moons are in the solar system?

Around 160.

* What is the rank of the moon's size?

5th.

* What is the internal core of the Moon?

Molten, hot core, much like the Earth.

* What are the highlands, and the marias?

Highlands: Cratered. Older rocks.
Maria: Smooth. No craters, younger rocks. Formed from lava overflow.

* What is the surface like on the far side of the Earth?

There are no maria. Thicker crust.
This is caused because during the formation of the Moon, the Earth was hot,
which caused the maria.

* What is the Giant Impact Hypothesis?

During the formation of the Moon, there were lots of large orbiting objects.
There was a big grazing collision from another "planet" and Earth.
The material ejected from this collision formed the Moon (from both Earth and
the other planet).

Evidence: Composition of some rocks on the Moon seem to be from the other
planet.

* What is the Late Heavy Bombardment?

A bombardment of comets from the outer solar system.
Caused the highland craters.

* What is Tycho?

A big, very visible crater on the moon.

* What are skylights?

Holes leading to the underground lava tunnels of the Moon.

* Where does water exist on the moon?

Near the poles, where in craters where there is no sunlight. Exists as ice.

# L7 - Terrestrial Planets

## Mercury

- Ellipetical
- Tidally locked at 2 years/3 days.

* What are the features of Mercury's surface?

- No atmosphere
- Lots of craters

# Lecture 9 - Small solar system bodies

## Asteroids

* What is the section that exists between Mars and Jupiter?

The asteroid belt. ("The Main Belt")

* What is the makeup of asteroids?

Usually carbon or silicon.

* What are Kirkwood Gaps?

Ring gaps in the asteroid belt due to Jupiter's orbital influence.

* What is the size of all the asteroids combined?

Smaller than the moon.

* What are some names of asteroids?

Ida, Ceres, Vesta.

* What is Ceres? What is its makeup?

- One of the larger asteroids in the asteroid belt.
- Has water in its core
- Has craters in the surface.

* How did the main asteroid belt form?

During the formation of the solar system, Jupiter ate a lot of the mass, but
there were still some left over. This leftover mass formed into smaller spheres
that were then influenced by Jupiter's mass.

## Comets

* What are comets usually made of?

Ice and dust.

* What are the two parts of comets?

The coma (the tails) and the nucleus (the core).

* What are the two tails of comets?

The dust tail, which glows white.
The ion tail, which glows in a color related to the Gas.

* How are comets classified?

By their orbits:
- Short-period comets (<200 years). Usually near the ecliptic
- Long-term comets (>200 years). Can appear anywhere

* What is outgassing?

The release of gas in comets due to the Sun heating the comet up. The gases
usually come from discreet places in the comet. There are "gas vents".

* Where do comets come from?

The Oort cloud.

* What did we find from comet samples?

Carbon molecules, including amino acids.

## Oort Cloud

* What is the Kuiper Belt?

A region just outside of Neptune where things there have stable orbits.
Pluto is part of the Kuiper Belt.
100000 objects, >100 km wide.
Source of short-period comets.

* What is the Oort Cloud?

The origin of long-period comets. A sphere of material around the solar system,
that extends very far away.

* What are some Kuiper Belt objects?

Krus, Charon, Pluto.

## Meteors

* What makes meteors hot?

The compression of the material in the meteor as it falls.

* Where do meteor showers come from?

Comets create a cloud of debris as they travel around the Sun. When the Earth
runs into this cloud, we get meteor showers.

* How do we date meterorites?

Carbon dating, or radioactive decay.

# Lecture 10 - Extrasolar planets.

* How are exoplanets first detected?

The star's orbit is also shifted by the planet. We can detect that shift as a
Doppler shift in the star's light.

* What are hot Jupiters?

Short-period, big planets. These were the first exoplanets that were discovered.

* What is a transit?

The exoplanet traveling in front of the star from the perspective of the Earth.
We can measure the drop in brightness caused by transits, and the amount the
sun dims by also tells us how large the planet is.

# Lecture 12 - Stars

* How are the fundamental distances to stars determined?

From stellar parallax, leveraging the orbit of the Earth throughout the year.

* What is the parsec?

The distance from which one would have a parallax of 1 arcsecond.

* What are the first stars measured using parallax?

61 Cyngni, by Dessel and Vega, by Struve.

* What is a star's brightness proportional to?

1 / distance^2

* What is the difference between brightness and luminosity?

Brightness is the total light energy collected from an object, while luminosity
is the total light energy emitted.

* What is the magnitude system for measuring brightness?

Invented by Hipparcos and refined by Ptolemy. A log scale for brightness.
First magnitude stars are 100 brighter than 6th magnitude stars.

* What is the difference between apparent and absolute magnitude?

Apparent: Brightness measured or observed.
Absolute: Brightness a star would have a distance of 10 parsecs.

* What determines the colour of a star?

Mostly temperature. Red (1000K) is cooler than blue (10000K).
Dust can also redden starlight.
The ratio of the brightnesses in two wavelengths.

* What is the standard classification of stars?

The OBAFGKM classification, which was later added to include subtypes (#s) and
widths of spectral lines (roman #s).

* What are brown dwarfs?

Objects that formed like stars, but didn't have the mass necessary for hydrogen
fusion. However, they can fuse Lithium or deuterium.

* What were brown dwarf's impact on the spectral classification system?

They didn't fit the classification system, and instead were found to be two
distinct types of stars.

L dwarfs: cooler than M9 stars, strong lines of metal hydrides, water absorption
T dwarfs: even cooler, dominated by bands of water and methane.

* What is the differences between stellar spectra and photometry?

Spectra requires bigger telescopes, but gives fine details.
Photometry gives good estimates, but is easier to do.

* What is the HR diagram?

Named after the people who invented it, it is a mass/spectra plot of stars.

* What is the main sequence w.r.t stars?

The line where most stars lie around in the mass/spectra plot.
The place where stars spend most of their lives, they do not move in the main
sequence.

* What are binary stars?

Two or more stars in orbit around a common centre of mass.

* What are the 4 kinds of binary stars?

Visual: Can see both stars
Astrometric: Only one star is visible, which moves around in a loop/wave.
Spectroscopic: Only one star is visible, shows no visible motion, but we can
detect with doppler shifts.
Eclipsing: One star passes in front of the other.

* What determines the lifetime of stars?

1. The amount of fuel (mass); and
2. The rate at which the star uses up the fuel.

Most massive stars have the shortest lives.

* What is the assumption we make about star clusters?

All stars in a cluster are roughly the same age, because they are form at the
same time in the same gas cloud.

* What are the 3 types of star clusters?

1. Associations: 100 stars
2. Open: 1000s stars
3. Globular: 100000 - 1000000 stars

* What does stellar motion tell us about stars?

Motion tells us about the gravity acting on the stars. More motion means
stronger gravity.

# Star clusters

* What are open clusters?

Loosely bound clusters of stars. Just formed by mutual gravity.
All stars orbit their collective center of mass, but might not be all in the
same plane.

* What are globular clusters?

Clusters of 100000s of stars in a spherical shape. These clusters are usually
very old. We assume they were the first stars to form.

* What is an assumption with star clusters?

All stars in the cluster are approximately the same age. This means that you can
determine the age of the cluster by measuring which stars are still on the
main sequence.

* What is an major assumption in stellar astrophysics?

If two stars have identical spectra and are on the Main Sequence, then they
are identical stars.

* What are pulsations in variations stars?

The star increases and decreases in size, which make also cause the surface
temperature to also vary.

* What are the 3 types of variable stars?

1. Pulsating stars.
2. Eruptive variables.
3. Rotating "spotted".

* What are the 3 common types of pulsating stars?

Cepheid: Period of 3-50 days, 0.2 magnitude variation, -1.5 to -5 absolute.
RR Lyrae: Period <1day, 1 absolute magnitude.
Mira: Period 80-600 days, large range in brightness

* What is the instability strip?

The place in the HR diagram that contains pulsating stars. This is caused by the
fact that heat cannot get out of the star, so it must pulsate instead to
release the heat.

* What is the period-luminosity law of cepheids?

Knowing L, b, we can find their distance (b = L/4pid^2)

Cepheid's pulsation period is related to its luminosity (and therefore radius).

* What are novae?

Stars that, one in a while, become much brighter (10000x) than before. Some
stars will repeat this behaviour decades/centuries later.

* How common are stellar collisions?

Very rare, but they can happen in dense clusters of stars.

## Nebulae

* What is a nebula?

Clouds of dust and gas in space.

* What is the difference between emission and reflection nebulae?

Emission: Illuminated by their own light.
Reflection: Illuminated by nearby stars' light. (More dusty)

# Stellar Evolution

* What is a helium flash?

Because low mass (<2Msum) stars struggle to fusion helium, the core becomes
degenerate and sudden ignition causes the core to expand and then shrink
suddenly.

* What happens after Helium is burned?

If the star is above 8Msun, it can still burn Carbon and Oxygen, but otherwise
that's about it.

* What are red giants?

Stars near the end of its lifetime, where it as expanded and cooled down.

* What is a white dwarf?

A star near the very end of its lifetime, it has blown off all of its
surrounding layers, and a carbon-based core remains.

Properties:
- Very dense
- Lots of radiation
- Glowing gas

Created when a stellar core less than 1.4Msun dies.

* What is a planetary nebula?

Glowing gas due to energy imparted by a white dwarf.

* What is the problem with fusing Iron?

Iron absorbs energy when fused, unlike the elements before it. This causes
the star to collapse.

* What is a supernova?

An exploding star. It has a supernova remnant, which is the gas and material
expelled by the star.

* Why are supernovas important for our existence?

Heavier elements are created by supernova, and these get distributed throughout
the universe.

## Neutron stars

* What are neutron stars?

A star made up almost entirely out of neutrons. They are supported by
neutron degeneracy pressure. It is also spinning super-fast due to the
conservation of angular momentum.

Created when a stellar core less than 2.8Msun dies.

It also has a crust with just "normal" matter, that has been squeezed

* What is a pulsar?

Neutron stars that have two "polar" beams of energy. Neutron stars spin
really fast so that the pulses will wash over the Earth periodically.

* What are magnetars?

Neutron stars with unusually strong magnetic fields. They are the most
magnetic objects in the universe.

* What is a star quake?

Conflict in force between the neutron's core and crust can cause an "earthquake".
This creates a "solar flare" that is insanely powerful.

A star quake once blinded an x-ray satellite, compressed Earth's magnetic field,
ionize upper atmosphere.

## Black holes

* What are black holes?

Created when a stellar core more than 2.8Msun dies.

* What is the event horizon?

The surface of the black hole where the escape velocity is the speed of light.

# Big Bang

* Why is the Era of Atoms called the cosmic dark ages?

Because hydrogen doesn't really emit protons, so little information can be
obtained.

* What is the current era of the universe?

Era of Galaxies.

* What are the problems with the theory of the Big Bang?

1. Why is there an imbalance in anti-matter?
2. Where does the structure come from?
3. Why is the large-scale universe so smooth?
4. Why is the density of matter almost exactly the critical density?

* What would have happened if the universe was not at the critical density?

If matter was 10% more dense, the universe would have collapsed by now.
If matter was 10% less dense, galaxies would not have formed.

* How old is the universe?

About 14 billion years old.
