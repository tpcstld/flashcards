# Lecture 12 - Stars

* How are the fundamental distances to stars determined?

From stellar parallax, leveraging the orbit of the Earth throughout the year.

* What is the parsec?

The distance from which one would have a parallax of 1 arcsecond.

* What are the first stars measured using parallax?

61 Cyngni, by Dessel and Vega, by Struve.

* What is a star's brightness proportional to?

1 / distance^2

* What is the difference between brightness and luminosity?

Brightness is the total light energy collected from an object, while luminosity
is the total light energy emitted.

* What is the magnitude system for measuring brightness?

Invented by Hipparcos and refined by Ptolemy. A log scale for brightness.
First magnitude stars are 100 brighter than 6th magnitude stars.

* What is the difference between apparent and absolute magnitude?

Apparent: Brightness measured or observed.
Absolute: Brightness a star would have a distance of 10 parsecs.

* What determines the colour of a star?

Mostly temperature. Red (1000K) is cooler than blue (10000K).
Dust can also redden starlight.
The ratio of the brightnesses in two wavelengths.

* What is the standard classification of stars?

The OBAFGKM classification, which was later added to include subtypes (#s) and
widths of spectral lines (roman #s).

* What were brown dwarf's impact on the spectral classification system?

They didn't fit the classification system, and instead were found to be two
distinct types of stars.

L dwarfs: cooler than M9 stars, strong lines of metal hydrides, water absorption
T dwarfs: even cooler, dominated by bands of water and methane.

* What is the differences between stellar spectra and photometry?

Spectra requires bigger telescopes, but gives fine details.
Photometry gives good estimates, but is easier to do.

* What is the main sequence w.r.t stars?

The line where most stars lie around in the mass/spectra plot.
The place where stars spend most of their lives, they do not move in the main
sequence.

* What are binary stars?

Two or more stars in orbit around a common centre of mass.

* What are the 4 kinds of binary stars?

Visual: Can see both stars
Astrometric: Only one star is visible, which moves around in a loop/wave.
Spectroscopic: Only one star is visible, shows no visible motion, but we can
detect with doppler shifts.
Eclipsing: One star passes in front of the other.

* What determines the lifetime of stars?

1. The amount of fuel (mass); and
2. The rate at which the star uses up the fuel.

Most massive stars have the shortest lives.

* What is the assumption we make about star clusters?

All stars in a cluster are roughly the same age, because they are form at the
same time in the same gas cloud.

* What are the 3 types of star clusters?

1. Associations: 100 stars
2. Open: 1000s stars
3. Globular: 100000 - 1000000 stars

* What does stellar motion tell us about stars?

Motion tells us about the gravity acting on the stars. More motion means
stronger gravity.

# Star clusters

* What is an major assumption in stellar astrophysics?

If two stars have identical spectra and are on the Main Sequence, then they
are identical stars.

* What are pulsations in variations stars?

The star increases and decreases in size, which make also cause the surface
temperature to also vary.

* What are the 3 types of variable stars?

1. Pulsating stars.
2. Eruptive variables.
3. Rotating "spotted".

* What are the 3 common types of pulsating stars?

Cepheid: Period of 3-50 days, 0.2 magnitude variation, -1.5 to -5 absolute.
RR Lyrae: Period <1day, 1 absolute magnitude.
Mira: Period 80-600 days, large range in brightness

* What is the instability strip?

The place in the HR diagram that contains pulsating stars. This is caused by the
fact that heat cannot get out of the star, so it must pulsate instead to
release the heat.

* What is the period-luminosity law of cepheids?

Knowing L, b, we can find their distance (b = L/4pid^2)

Cepheid's pulsation period is related to its luminosity (and therefore radius).

* What are novae?

Stars that, one in a while, become much brighter (10000x) than before. Some
stars will repeat this behaviour decades/centuries later.

* How common are stellar collisions?

Very rare, but they can happen in dense clusters of stars.

# Big Bang

* Why is the Era of Atoms called the cosmic dark ages?

Because hydrogen doesn't really emit protons, so little information can be
obtained.

* What is the current era of the universe?

Era of Galaxies.

* What are the problems with the theory of the Big Bang?

1. Why is there an imbalance in anti-matter?
2. Where does the structure come from?
3. Why is the large-scale universe so smooth?
4. Why is the density of matter almost exactly the critical density?

* What would have happened if the universe was not at the critical density?

If matter was 10% more dense, the universe would have collapsed by now.
If matter was 10% less dense, galaxies would not have formed.

* How old is the universe?

About 14 billion years old.
