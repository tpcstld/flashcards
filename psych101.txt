and nervous system.

* What is the principle of eugenics?

privileges to nuture them.

* What are some examples of Galton's intelligence questions?

- "When can you feel the difference in weight between two hands?"

* How did Galton get, and use, his data?

He went all "travelling salesman" and put on "shows" to get such data.
Afterwards, he used his invented linear regression to find correlations in the
data.

* What was Galton's conclusion on the principle of eugenics?

Galton's eugenics hypothesis was disproved by his data analysis. However people
still believed in it.

* What did Darwin believe about intelligence?

* What are the poor laws?

You could be thrown into prison for being poor.

* What were Binet's beliefs about intelligence?

* What is Spearman's two factor theory for intelligence?

There are two factors: "s" (specific) and "g" (general).

The "g" factor is general intelligence, an overall mental ability common to
all intellectual tasks. This is biological, and draws parallel with Galton's
idea.

The "s" factor is specific intelligence, mental abilities applicable to only
specific tasks. This is learned, and draws parallel with Binet's theory.

question can produce different results.

## Slides

* What are the 3 ways we measure motivation?

1. Intensity: Energy, enthusiasm, degree of effort exerted.
2. Direction: Avoidance of alternative activities. Degree of task difficulty selected.
3. Persistence: Commitment to choices, continued effort following frustration.

* What are instincts?

Fixed, rigid, and predictable patterns of behaviour that is

- Not acquired by learning
- Common to all members of the species
- Likely rooted in genes

* Are humans motivated by instincts?

It seems that our behaviour is less prescribed by genetics than other animals.
We have general patterns explained as emerging through natural selection.

* What is the drive reduction theory w.r.t motivation?

We have a drive to do certain things, like eating, and we do things to fulfill
that drive.

* What is the psychodynamic theory w.r.t motivation?

We have unconscious instincts, needs, and wishes. This causes intrapsychic
conflicts.

"If I haven't aggressed in a period of time, the pressure keeps building."

Instead of aggressing, through, you can instead do some aggressive-like
behaviours to release some of that need and gain catharsis.

* What is the law of effect w.r.t motivation?

If something has a positive outcome, we are more likely to do the behaviour.
Similarily, we are less likely to do some behaviour which is less desirable.

* What is Maslow's hierarchy of needs?

Humans strive to ensure that basic needs are satisfied before they find
motivation to pursue goals that are higher on the hierarchy.

* What are some critiques of Maslow's hierarchy of needs?

- There is no empirical support for the hierarchy.
- Many of the needs "higher up" are just as important as the needs below (e.g. attractment)
- Many of the self-actualized people turned out to be "arrogant idiots"

* What is Roger's Discrepancy Theory w.r.t motivation?

We have a continuous desire to be our ideal self. We are continuously comparing
our current self to our ideal self. We want to partake in behaviours to reach
our ideal self.

If the discrepancy between the ideal and the real got too far apart, then it is
demotivating. However, if the discrepancy is closer, then we are more motivated
because self-actualization is more attainable.

This is a never-ending state, because as the person is achieving their goals,
they move their ideal-self even further. But it is something that we can strive
to be.

* What is the expectancy approach w.r.t motivation?

We make choices, and our motivation is determined by those choices.
I have an expected outcome, which includes:

- The desired outcome.
- The likelihood of achieving that outcome.

Wherever the gain x likely equation comes out the best, that's where people
are most motivated to do the task.

* What is the criticism of the expectancy approach w.r.t motivation?

People do not always choose the "best" choices. Some choose the most dangerous
choice, or others choose the easiest choice.

* What is the self-efficacy theory w.r.t motivation?

An improvement on the expectancy approach. It can be equated to a statement
of confidence. Before judging the expected value, we first check our efficacy.

- "Do I have the skills, experience, and strategy to perform the task?"
- "Can I execute under the circumstances?"

If the answer to any of these questions is "no", then confidence plummets. And
then the expected value does not matter.

* What are some sources of self-efficacy?

- Successful past performances.
  - Long lasting source.
- Vicarious experiences
  - Learning from others.
  - Only influential until own reproduction
- Social persuasion.
  - Depends on credibility of source (which can be damaged)
  - Brief duration.
- Emotional Arousal
  - Getting psyched out/psyched up.
  - Brief duration.

* What is the cognitive valuation theory w.r.t motivation?

A behaviour can be intrinsically rewarding. (play)
The outcome can also be extrinsically rewarding. (work)

If we increase the intrinsic value of an activity, we can improve the
motivation of the task, because it's a second source of motivation.

* How does cognitive valuation theory explain burnout?

If you are doing a task that has intrinsic rewards, and then you add
extrinsic rewards, there is an additive effect.

However, in some cases, this can backfire when the extrinsic interest dominates
the motivation, it can undermine the intrinsic rewards and cause the intrinsic
rewards to fade away.

* What were some of the professor's example for burnout?

- Sports players, where the money overtakes them. Recovered by taking a break
  and playing other sports.
- A dentist, where the number of patients increased too much. Recovered by
  volunteering at Doctor's without Borders.

* When is extrinsic motivation additive vs undermining?

Additive:
  Informative outcomes
  Feedback about skills, capacities, and quality of performance
  Motivated to produce maximum performance to test skills and efficacy
Undermining:
  Controlling outcomes
  Controlling freedom and mandatory performance
  Motivated to produce minimum performance necessary to produce extrinsic rewards.

* What are the two sources of positive self-esteem w.r.t social identity?

1. Personal identity; distinguishes self from others; enhanced by achievements; skills
2. Social identity; aligns self with others, enhanced by affiliations; groups

* What is the buffering hypothesis w.r.t social identity?

If you have good personal AND social identity, then you're not as impacted by
damages to a single identity because the other one can provide a buffer for you.

(e.g. Athletes recover better from academic problems.)

* What characterizes a robust esteem w.r.t social identity theory?

When the person has multiple personal and social identities, their self
esteem is robust to damage.

* What is the self-serving bias?

We align ourselves with success, and distance ourselves from failure. "We won",
"they lost".

* What is approach avoidance w.r.t esteem strategies?

- When I have good self-esteem, I want to choose the task when a 50% chance
  of success.
- However, if I have weak self-esteem, I want to choose the task with the
  highest chance of success.
- Also, if I have weak self-esteem, I might also choose the hardest task,
  taking a defensive esteem challenge. If I fail it doesn't matter since
  everyone fails.
