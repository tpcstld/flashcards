# Key concepts in Economics

* What is scarcity?

Our inability to satisfy all our wants.

* What does scarcity cause us to do?

Make choices.

* What is an incentive?

A reward that encourages an action, or a penalty that discourages an action.

* What is economics?

The social science that studies the choices that individuals, businesses,
governments, and societies make as they cope with scarcity, and the incentives
that influence and reconcile those choices.

* What is microeconomics?

The study of choices that individuals and businesses make, and how those choices
interact in markets; and the influence of governments.

* What is macroeconomics?

The study of the performance of the national and global economies.

* What are the two big economic questions?

1. How do choices end up determining what, how, and for whom goods and services
   are produced?
2. When do choices made in the pursuit of self-interest also promote the social interest?

* What are goods and services?

Objects that people value and produce to satisfy human wants.

* How does level-of-development affect what goods and services are produced?

Countries with a higher level of development tend to produce less agriculture
goods, proportionally.

* What is a Factor of production?

Resources that are used to produce goods and services.

* What are the 4 categories of factors of production?

1. Land
2. Labour
3. Capital
4. Entrepreneurship

* What is Land w.r.t factors of production?

"Gifts of Nature" that we use to produce goods and services.

* What is Labour w.r.t factors of production?

The work time and work effort that people devote to producing goods and services.

The "quality" of labour, i.e. the knowledge and skill that people obtain from
education, training and experience.

* What is Capital w.r.t factors of production?

The tools, instruments, machines, buildings, and other constructions that
businesses use to produce goods and services.

* What is Entrepreneurship w.r.t factors of production?

The human resource that organizes land, labour and capital.

* What is self-interest w.r.t choices?

You make choices that are in your self-interest -- choices that you think
are best for you.

* What is social interest w.r.t choices?

Choices that are best for society as a whole are said to be in social interest.

* What are the two dimensions of social interest?

1. Efficiency
2. Equity

* When is a choice efficient?

If it is not possible to make someone better off without making someone else
worse off.

* When is a choice equitable?

Fairness, but economists have a variety of views about what is fair.

1. Globalization
    Economic crises can affect the whole world.
2. Information-age monopolies
3. Global warming
4. Economic instability

* What 6 ideas define the economic way of thinking?

1. A choice is a tradeoff.
2. People make rational choices by comparing benefits and costs.
3. A benefit is what your gain from something.
4. Cost is what you must give up to get something.
5. Most choices are "how-much" choices made at the margin.
6. Choices respond to incentives.

* What does "a choice is a tradeoff" mean?

Choices are an exchange between outcomes. Giving something up to get another
thing. Whatever you choose you could have chosen something else.

* What is a "rational choice"?

A choice that compares costs and benefits and achieves the greatest benefit
over cost for the person making the choice.

* What is a benefit?

The value that you gain.

* What is opportunity cost?

The cost of something is the highest-valued alternative that must be given up
to get it.

* What is the margin?

Most choices are not all or nothing, you can decide to dedicate only "half" of
something.

Costs and benefits change when you have more or less of something, you can
make your choice at the margin.

* What the "marginal benefit" and "marginal cost"?

MB: The benefit from pursuing an incremental increase in an activity.
MC: The opportunity cost of pursuing an incremental increase in an activity.

If MB > MC, then you should do more of the activity.

* How do choices respond to incentives?

Changing marginal cost or benefits changes the incentives we face and can lead
us to change our choice.

Idea: We can predict how choices will change by looking at changes in incentives.

* When have we achieved production efficiency?

When we cannot produce more of any one good without giving up some other
good.

2. Proportion of income spent on the good
  Greater the portion of income, more elastic
3. Time elapsed since a price change
  More time consumers have to adjust to a price change, more elastic
  Unperishable goods are elastic

* How do we calculate the total revenue?

Price of good * quantity sold.

* What should we do if demand is elastic?

Lower the price, because a 1% drop in price means a > 1% increase in sales.

* What should we do if demand is inelastic?

Raise the price, because a 1% raise in price results in a <1% decrease in sales.

* What should we do if demand is unit elastic?

Nothing.

* What is the total revenue test?

A method of estimating the price elasticity of demand

Observe the change in total revenue from a price cut.
  If down, inelastic
  If up, elastic
  If nothing, unit elastic

* At what point do we achieve maximum revenue?

When we produce at the point where the price elasticity of demand is unit elastic.

* How is your expenditure affected by price elasticity of demand?

If your demand is:
  elastic, then 1% price cut means you'll spend more than 1% more on the item.
    Expenditure increases
  inelastic, then 1% price cut means you'll spend less than 1% more on the item
    Expenditure decreases
  unit elastic, then 1% price cut means you'll spend 1% more on the item
    Expenditure does not change

* What is the income elasticity of demand?

Measures how the quantity demanded responses to a change income.

% change in quantity demanded / % change in income.

* When is a good income elastic?

When the income elasticity of demand is greater than 1.

* What is momentary, short-run, and long-run supply and their elasticity?

Momentary: Perfectly inelastic.
Short-run: Somewhat elastic.
Long-run: Most elastic.

* What is cross elasticity of demand?

Comparison of how Product A's quantity demanded changes when Product B's price changes.

% change in quantity demanded of Product A / % change in price of Product B

* When are two goods close substitutes?

When their cross elasticity of demand is high.

# Utility

* What are comsumption possibilities?

All the things that you can afford to buy.

A consumption choice is affordable iff it is on a point below the budget line.

* What is utility?

The benefit or satisfaction from consuming a good or service.

* What is marginal utility?

The change in total utility that results from a unit-increase in the quantity of
the good consumed.

* What is the principle of diminishing marginal utility?

As quantity of the good consumed increases, the marginal utility of each
additional consumption decreases.

* How do we assume we will choose our consumption?

We choose the consumption choice that maximizes total utility.

* What is the consumer equilibrium?

The situation where we have allocated all of our income in the way that
maximizes our total utility.

* How do consumption choices move when the price of a good falls?

The consumer will buy more of that good, and buy less of another good, to
restore consumer equilibrium.

* How do consumption choices move when the price of a good rises?

The consumer will buy less of that good, and buy more of another good, to
restore consumer equilibrium.

* How do consumption choices with normal goods move when income rises?

The consumer will buy more of both goods, in proportions that maintain consumer
equilibrium.

* What is the paradox of value?

Why do essential goods, such as water, cost less than luxury goods, such as
diamonds.

* What is the resolution for the paradox of value?

While the total utility gained from essential goods is high, we use so much of
it that the marginal utility is low.

In contrast, the marginal utility of a luxury good is high.

to get one more Good 2, as the quantity of Good 2 increases.

* What does the indifference curve show when the goods are perfect complements?

Straight (vertical/horizontal) line while we have more of one good than the
other. This is because we cannot use more of one without more of another.

* What does the indifference curve show when the goods are perfect substitutes?

A straight, sloped, line.

* What does the indifference curve show when the goods are ordinary goods?

A round curve.

* What are the 3 properties of a consumer's best affordable choice?

3. Has a marginal rate of substitution equal to the relative price of the two
   goods.

* Where is a consumer's best affordable choice on the graph?

The intersection between the budget line and the best indifference line.

* How is can we explain the gain in quantity consumed when price falls with 2 effects?

1. Substitution effect: changes the slope of the budget line while staying at
   the original indifferent curve.
2. Income effect: Shifts the budget line to a new indifference curve.

# Organizing production

* What is a firm?

An institution that hires factors of production and organizes them to sell
goods and services.

* What is a firm's goal?

To maximize profit.

* What happens if a firm fails to maximize profit?

It will be eliminated or taken over by a firm that seeks to maximize profit.

Cost of using resources:

1. Bought in the market
2. Owned by the firm
3. Supplied by firm's owner

* Why are resources bought in the market considered a part of the firm's opportunity cost of production?

* What are the 3 constraints that limit a firm's profit?

1. Technology constraints.
2. Information constraints.
3. Market constraints.

* How do technology constraints limit a firm's profit?

Using the available technology, the firm can produce more only if it hires
more resources, which will increase its costs and limit the profit.

* How do information constraints limit a firm's profit?

A firm never possess complete information about the present or future, and the
cost of coping with limited information limits profit.

* How do market constraints limit a firm's profit?

The price of a good is limited by its customer's willingness to pay, and by
the prices and marketing efforts of other firms.

The resources a firm can buy are limited by the prices it must spend on them,
and the willingness for people to work/invest in the firm.

A firm must spend money to overcome these constraints.

* When is technological efficiency achieved?

When a firm uses the least amount inputs to produce a given quantity of output.

* When is economic efficiency achieved?

When a firm produces a given quantity of output at the least cost.

* What is the difference between technological and economic efficiency?

Technological: Concerned with quantity of inputs
Economic: Concerned with cost of inputs

* Why does economic efficiency imply technological efficiency, but not vice versa?

Because if you can reduce some inputs, you can lower the cost. (E => T)
However, you can have many variations on with lowest input, but only a few
have lowest cost. (T =/> E)

* What are the two systems a firm uses to organize production?

1. Command systems.
2. Incentive systems.

* What is a command system?

A managerial hierarchy where commands pass downwards and information passes
upwards. Rigid can have many layers of specialized management.

* What is an incentive system?

A method of organizing production that uses a market-like mechanism to induce
workers to perform in ways that maximize profit.

* Why do firms use command or incentive systems?

Command: Easy to monitor performance; small deviation from ideal performance is
costly.
Incentive: Monitoring performance is too hard.

* What is the principal-agent problem?

The problem of devising compensation rules that induce an agent to act in the
best interests of a principal.

* What are the 3 ways to cope with the principal-agent problem?

1. Ownership; gives managers incentive to maximize profits.
2. Incentive pay; links manager pay to firm's performance.

A cost incurred by the firm and cannot be changed.

* How can a firm increase output in the short run?

A firm must increase the labour employed.

* What is the total product?

The total output produced in a given period.

* What is the marginal product of labour?

The change in total product that results for a one-unit increase in the
quantity of labour employed, all other inputs remaining the same.

* What is the average product of labour?

The total product divided by quantity of labour employed.

* What happens as quantity of labour employed increases?

- Total product increases;
- marginal product increases, but eventually decreases;
- Average product decreases.

* What is a product curve?

- Something that shows how the firm's total product, marginal product, and
average product change as the firm varies the quantity of labour employed.

* What is the total product curve?

Similar to the PPF, separates attainable from unattainable output levels.

* What is the law of diminishing returns?

As a firm uses more of a variable input with a given quantity of fixed inputs,
the marginal product of the variable input eventually diminishes.

* What is marginal cost?

The increase in total cost that results from a one-unit increase in total
product.
